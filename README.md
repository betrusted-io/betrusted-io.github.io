Betrusted is a secure and private communications system. It gives
users an evidence-based reason to believe that private matters are
kept private.

Betrusted is more than just an app, and more than just a gadget -- it
is a co-designed hardware + software solution that provides safe
defaults for everyday users. It's also open source, empowering
advanced users to analyze, extend and explore this secure mobile
computer.

Developers can get started by [visiting our documentation wiki](https://github.com/betrusted-io/betrusted-wiki/wiki).

# Our Core Principles

Betrusted is designed around the principles of transparency,
simplicity, completeness, and self-sealing.

### Transparency

Transparency is the bedrock of trust. Understanding what makes a thing
tick gives us an evidence-based reason to trust that it works as
intended. Betrusted is unique in that, instead of a black-box CPU
chip, it uses reconfigurable hardware – an FPGA – for
computation. This means you can compile our reference processor design
from source, instead of simply having to accept on faith that this
black epoxy rectangle contains precisely the circuits it
advertises. Furthermore, we are at liberty to introduce
countermeasures against known and future threats in the silicon supply
chain by re-designing and re-compiling our processors.

### Simplicity

Simplicity addresses the reality of only having 24 hours in a
day. Even though the full source code for the Linux kernel and Firefox
is published, nobody has the time to personally review every release
for potential security problems; we simply trust that others have done
a good job, because we have no other choice. Betrusted rolls the clock
back to the early 2000’s, when mobile computers were powerful enough
to be useful for single tasks, while simple enough that individuals or
small teams could build them from scratch. But don't worry, despite
its simplicity, Betrusted’s computational capability exceeds that of
the Palm Pilot series. It's more on par with a Nintendo DS: sufficient
for core security tasks such as authentication, instant messaging,
and even end-to-end encrypted voice calls.

### Completeness

Trust should begin at your fingertips and end at your eyes. Screen
grabbers and keyboard loggers mean that chip-only trust solutions,
such as TPMs, SGX, and secure enclaves are insufficient; we need a
complete, end-to-end solution. Private keys are not the same as our
private matters, and until we can encrypt data directly to and from
our brains, the "analog hole" will be a real problem. With Betrusted,
the complete loop of components from the keyboard to the display has
been curated for transparency and simplicity, thus minimizing those
attack surfaces that cannot be cryptographically secured.

### Self-sealing

“Three can keep a secret, if two of them are dead”. As Benjamin
Franklin acutely observed, relying on trusted third parties to
provision our keys is imprudent: self-sealing is the only way to keep
a secret. Betrusted requires no special tools, NDAs, or third-party
expertise to provision the system with secrets: it can generate and
seal its own private keys on-chip in a transparent and open
manner. 

# Our Solution

Security is hard to get right, and even the tiniest crack can be
enough of a toehold for attackers to compromise the entire
system.

Betrusted takes the approach of a co-designed hardware and software
solution, because many of the cracks occur at the boundary of hardware
and software. That being said, each element of Betrusted is
potentially useful for non-security critical applications in their own
right. Despite our integrated philosophy, each element is modularized
so others can leverage our efforts for their own needs. Here is a
brief overview of the elements that will make up Betrusted.

## Hardware: A Precursor to Betrusted

<center><a href="https://www.crowdsupply.com/sutajio-kosagi/precursor"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/betrusted-io/betrusted-io.github.io/blob/master/assets/images/precursor_to_betrusted.png" width="50%"></a></center>

The development hardware for Betrusted is available as an
application-neutral platform called Precursor. It was developed in
part with funding through the [NGI0 PET Fund](https://nlnet.nl/PET), a
fund established by NLnet with financial support from the European
Commission's [Next Generation Internet](https://ngi.eu/) programme.

At 7.2mm thin, Precursor is a pocketable mobile hardware development
platform for secure applications. It embodies the principles of
transparency, simplicity, completeness and self-sealing in a physical
form. At its core lies not a CPU, but an FPGA, so that users are
empowered to build their processors from scratch and know there are no
flaws or backdoors in the architecture that could lead to security
compromises.

## Xous: Extending Memory Safety to the OS

<a href="https://github.com/betrusted-io/xous-core">Xous</a> is the
microkernel OS for Betrusted. It's written in Rust, and not just
because Rust is a trendy language. Xous extends Rust-style memory
borrow checking to the operating system level. Unlike POSIX systems
which treat everything like a file, Xous uses the <em>Message</em> as its
fundamental data unit. Memory is shared between processes as a
Message, with attributes of Borrow, Mutable Borrow, or Move. Processes
"own" specific pages of memory, and attempts to access other memory
results in a "panic". This is identical in concept to inter-thread
communication in normal Rust. The hope is that by matching the OS
level concepts around sharing memory between threads to the underlying
language used to implement programs, we can eliminate or greatly
reduce a large class of memory-safety related bugs.  Of course, Xous
can unsafely run binaries written in any language, but the OS-level
bindings will be Rust-native, as opposed to C-native.

Xous' Message model for memory sharing also facilitates cross-platform
development. This is because Messages can also be implemented by
sending data over a network socket, meaning that the kernel and its
services need not be restricted to run on a single physical machine.
This enables easier debugging when actual hardware is unavailable.  It
also enables the use of traditional tools such as profilers on the
kernel when running on the desktop. You can try it out now by following the
directions at the <a
href="https://github.com/betrusted-io/xous-core">Xous github page</a>.

## PDDB: Extending Your Safety to the "Filesystem"

The problem with building a device that is extremely good at keeping
secrets is that it turns the user into the weakest link. 

<center><a href="https://xkcd.com/538/"><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/security.png"></a></center>

In practice, authorities need not even go so far as <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber-hose_cryptanalysis">rubber-hose
cryptanalysis</a> to obtain passwords; simply demanding a user's
passwords at Customs as a pre-condition for entry into a country has
become a normalized deviance.

Therefore, enhanced security must come hand-in-hand with enhanced
plausible deniability (PD) of any secrets that may or may not be
contained within the system. PD is possible on traditional systems,
but it is tricky; it is hard to train user to use the tools, and easy
for apps to accidentally leave incriminating traces. It is also hard
to say for sure on modern SSDs if data has been actually deleted or
merely de-allocated.

The Plausibly Deniable DataBase (PDDB) is our answer-in-development to
this problem. We plan to take advantage of the Message-oriented nature
of Xous and our tight integration with the Precursor hardware layer to
entirely do away with the notion of files and volumes. Instead, data
is stored in a database as a set of key/value pairs that are
associated with a security state. The set of user-visible data is
transparently adjusted depending upon the set of PIN codes currently
authorized by the user. We blend patterns of secure and insecure data
access together all the way down to the hardware, while keeping
end-user applications largely oblivious to the entire PD process. For
example, the process of deleting a data set is identical to that of
forgetting a PIN code. This makes it difficult to determine at the
point of inspection if a complete set of PIN codes have been turned
over.


### Additional Planned Features 

Making it easy for users to visually identify security-critical
interactions is an essential countermeasure to phishing. We are in the
process of building a simple graphical toolkit for building user
interfaces that factor security into the rendering of graphics. It is
particularly dangerous to allow applications to render full-screen
bitmaps, as it gives compromised applications a way to trick users
into divulging secrets. The graphics subsystem provided by Betrusted
will put a special border around any bitmaps coming from an untrusted
source, while reserving a region of the screen exclusively for icons
that indicate the current security state of the system.


# Development Status

Delivering a bespoke, hardware-to-user-app solution is a multi-year
development process. As of September 2020, we're about two years
into the project, and we are:

* Currently finalizing the Precursor hardware platform and preparing for crowdfunding
* In alpha stages of Xous development, with a PoC kernel running in emulation mode
* In the conceptual (napkin-sketch) stages of PDDB development
* In planning stages of higher-level features such as graphics and end user applications
